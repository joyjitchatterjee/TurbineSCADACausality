# TurbineSCADACausality
Supplementary material for our TORQUE 2020 Submission "Temporal Causal Inference in Wind Turbine SCADA Data Using Deep Learning for Explainable AI"

# Contents 
This repository contains:-
1. Flowchart of preprocessing process towards labelling of faults in SCADA data and cleaning, for temporal causal inference.
2. Additional temporal causal graphs for higher significance measure e.g. 0.95, wherein we obtained several hidden confounders, many of which are difficult to explain in principle, but affect the prediction ability of the CNN.


# Acknowledgments
We would like to acknowledge the Offshore Renewable Energy (ORE) Catapult for providing us access to operational data from the turbine through Platform for Operational Data (POD) (http://pod.ore.catapult.org.uk). We are also grateful to Aura Innovation Centre and the University of Hull for their support.

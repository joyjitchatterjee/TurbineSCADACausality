We would like to acknowledge the Offshore Renewable Energy (ORE) Catapult for providing us access to operational data from the turbine through Platform for Operational Data (POD) (http://pod.ore.catapult.org.uk). We are also grateful to Aura Innovation Centre and the University of Hull for their support.
